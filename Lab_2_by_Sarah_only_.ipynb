        "Your task will be to design, write, and implement a Python program that will process the incoming students’ information to determine the expected total tuition and fees that will be collected for that student.  You will then also let the student know what their payment(s) will be to cover the cost of tuition/fees based on how they plan to play the amount.\n",

        "·       Whole (code ‘w’) – The student just pays the amount owed right now.\n",
        "·       Semi-annually (code ‘s’) – The student makes two payments total for the year.  Because we don’t get all the money up front, there is an interest charge (you’ll need to determine what that interest rate is in your program).\n",

        "In all situations where the student is not paying the bill in full today, you will need to calculate the per period payment (note that this is what is referred to as an amortized payment amount … this payment includes part of payment as well as part of the interest too).  The formula for calculating an amortized payment amount is:\n",
        "\n",
        "Where i is the periodic interest rate, n is the total number of periods, P is the principal (or total amount owed), and A will be the amortized payment amount (how much the student is going to pay per period of payment).\n",
        "You should create an amortization function to handle the calculation of the amortized payment amount.  The function must receive the principal, the periodic interest rate, and the number of periods of payment an appropriate RETURN usage.  You may not use/create global variables in any of the functions nor use variables that have the same name in the main program as in the function(s) (hint: you will need to use functions with a RETURN and that pass arguments that are stored in parameters).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The program will then print out a statement that tells the use that they are paying in whole or that they are paying ‘monthly,’ ‘quarterly,’ or ‘semi-annually’ (based on their selection) and then and how much they owe right now (or per period if they are paying monthly, quarterly, or semi-annually)."
