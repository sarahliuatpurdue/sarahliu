        "Your task will be to design, write, and implement a Python program that will process the incoming students’ information to determine the expected total tuition and fees that will be collected.  There are several items that go into determining tuition and fees for each student based on the type of student (in-district or out-of-district), whether they are playing on a sports team, lunch options (bringing their own lunch, getting the standard lunch, or the premium lunch), and student status (initial year, graduation year, other).  Details about the various items are as follows:\n",

        "*   Students not playing a sport have no sport fee charged (i.e., $0.00)\n",
